# FragEva6-Guard: High-Performance IPv6 Fragment Evasion Threat Detection Method Based on eBPF and XDP
We have developed FragEva6-Guard, a high-performance and flexible framework based on eBPF and XDP, designed for detecting and mitigating IPv6 fragment evasion threats. Using this framework, you can implement custom parsing programs for other IPv6 extension header threats.
